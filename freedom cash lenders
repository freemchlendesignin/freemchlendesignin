Thanks to high-speed Internet and quick online services, getting a loan is easier than it used to be, say, 20 years earlier. As with any service, payday loans are associated with their own set of plus and minus points. The trick lies in being able to discern exactly when such a loan would be useful.

Before explaining when a payday loan would be useful to you, it's important to understand when NOT to apply for one. Here are some situations where such instant loans might not be the best option:

You have already availed of a loan which you are in the process of repaying. Avoid applying for a second loan to pay off the first; this is usually the beginning of a vicious cycle of debt
You require a loan for impulse spending or spending on luxury or non-essential items; if you want to buy that expensive perfume, hold on until you have enough money to do so. The same goes for holidays, gifts and clothes shopping
Your income is low. Keep in mind that fast loans are usually expensive. The interest rates are exorbitant. If you earn a low income, these might not be for you. Ask for help from your bank or financial advisor instead
